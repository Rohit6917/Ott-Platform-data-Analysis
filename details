🎬 Project Title: OTT Platform Data Analysis Dashboard
📊 Overview:
This Power BI dashboard provides a deep analysis of user engagement, performance, and content preferences across an OTT (Over-The-Top) streaming platform, possibly something like JioCinema, Netflix, etc.

🔍 Key Dashboard Insights:
✅ 1. User Behavior & Engagement
Active Users by Region/Device: It shows how many users are active from different locations (e.g., cities/states) and devices (mobile, smart TV, desktop).

Average Watch Time: Helps identify how long users spend on the platform. Higher watch time = better engagement.

Peak Viewing Hours: Highlights what time users are most active — e.g., evenings or weekends, helpful for release planning.

🎞️ 2. Content Insights
Top Genres Watched: Reveals which genres (e.g., Drama, Action, Comedy) are most popular. Can be visualized as a bar or donut chart.

Top Viewed Content (Movies/Series): Shows the most-watched titles, indicating content popularity and trends.

Language Preferences: Shows which content languages users prefer — Hindi, English, Tamil, etc.

💰 3. Subscription & Revenue Metrics
Revenue by Subscription Tier: Visualizes earnings from Basic, Premium, and Family plans.
